Some exercises are very challenging to write appropriate SCTs for.

Before you create an issue, make sure to [check the wiki](https://www.github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki). This wiki has an article on nearly every SCT function that's in `pythonwhat`, with examples and further explanation.

If you still haven't figured out the appropriate SCT, or you believe certain functionality is missing, you can create an issue. In this issue:

- Make the problem easy to reproduce: point to the __source code__ (not the DataCamp exercise!), or mention the pre-exercise code and solution code.
- Explain exactly what you want to test with the SCT, and which message you want it to return for a given submission.
- Explain what you have already tried (include the code) and why the documentation is not helping you (that way, the documentation can be updated afterwards).

Thanks!
