Some exercises are very challenging to write appropriate SCTs for. In your issue, be sure to include,

1. Where you looked in [the wiki](https://www.github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki).
2. A link to the __source code__ (i.e. an RMarkdown file), or a copy of the exact pre-exercise and solution code.
3. What you want to test with the SCT, and which message you want it to return for a given submission. (Be exact).
4. What you have already tried (include the code) and why the documentation is not helping you (that way, the documentation can be updated afterwards).

Thanks!
