Simple Tests
============

Simple tests are the most basic tests available in pythonwhat. 
They usually don't focus on specific pieces of a submission (:doc:`like part checks <part_checks`), or re-run any code (:doc:`like expression tests <expressions>`).
Instead, they simply look at things like imports, printed output, or raw code text.
A final, common use is to test the value of a variable in the final environment (that is, after the submission of solution code have been run).
